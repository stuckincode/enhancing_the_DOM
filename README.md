# enhancing_the_DOM
Uploading personnal work I did

This was a course a did on lynda.com with Ray Villalobos.
The course was in JavaScript and this basically creates a lightbox. What I did was to fallow along but because I wanted a better 
understanging of jQuery I did the code in jQuery insted of pure JS.

If you have any comments on the code or know a way to make it better cleaner of to better fallow best practices don't hesitate
share your thoughts.
